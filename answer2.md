# What is the computational complexity of your answer in Question 1? Can you explain why?
Subset Module is developed by nodeJS that consist a native sorting function.
As information in internet, native sorting is implemented with QuickSort.
Therefore BigO for time-complexity best case is O(nLog(n)) and worst case is O(Log(n^2)) and space-complexity is O(log(n))
